      Made up of teens from around the globe, we hope to create a new messaging
      app that will change the way you think about privacy and anonymity. We
      want to revolutionize the way messaging apps work and make it so that
      instead of being the product, you're using a product that works for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're currently in the early stages of development and are looking for
      people to help us test our app. If you're interested in helping us test
      our app, please sign up for our mailing list below. (We promise not to
      send you any spam, only important milestones which will result in less
      than 4-5 emails a year)
